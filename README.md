# Getting Started with Vite

This project was initially created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) but has been migrated to [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start:both`

Runs both the client and server concurrently in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the client in your browser, and [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view the server.

The page will reload when you make changes to either the client or server code.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner for the client in the interactive watch mode.\
*Note: This command should be run from the `client` directory.*

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

*Note: This command should be run from the `client` directory.*

Builds both the client and server for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React and optimizes the client build for the best performance.

The server build is minified and ready to be deployed.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
*Note: This command should be run from the `client` directory.*

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` the client at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
